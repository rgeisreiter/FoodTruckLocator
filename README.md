# <Food Truck Locator>

## Description

We are motivted by our love of food!. We love to eat the delicious food from food trucks, but have always found it very difficult to find the exact locations of them. We built this project in hope to solve this problem and help people find the food truck they so often crave. We learned that working with APIs can be very difficult because data is money so it is tough to find one for free.

## Installation

The installation simply requires opening a webpage.

## Usage

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

When the user visits the site, they are presented with an option to select their city of choice. Upon doing so, they are redirected to another page where their results will be displayed along with a map.

When you run the site for the first time, there is potential for an error. If you receive this error, click on the button to request access and you will be let in. The problem will not occur again.
